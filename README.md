# inex-bis
Extra scripts written throughout my internship at INEX (AEC, BIM...) that don't have much to do with my main project. 

## table of contents
- `epw_metadata.py`: simple script to extract metadata from EPW files (written for one of our engineers)
- `compare_pdfs.py`: the idea was to compare tables in two pdfs, which a little bit more tricky. (come back to it later)
